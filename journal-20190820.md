## Golang template
Today I worked on composing html templates in Golang. This is not as easy as in most languages :(
Each partial template needs to be compiled and the glue between them happen by cloning the base template and calling the [ParseFiles](https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/#ParseFiles) function on the cloned base template. I illustrate it in my [golang sandbox example](https://github.com/toff63/golang-sandbox/blob/master/pkg/render/main.go).
